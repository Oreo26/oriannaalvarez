    <p>
      Hi my name is Orianna Alvarez and I am currently 23 years old. I am
      majoring in Business Management and minoring in Design. I am a scorpio and
      my favorite color is red. I like to design for fun and spend a lot of time
      trying new things with a Cricut. I've learned how design tumblers, shadow
      boxes, and most recently Christmas ornaments.
    </p>

          <img src="img/thumb-logoposter.png" alt="Thumbnail">
        </a>
        <figcaption>The purpose of this assignment was to create a logo for a company and develop a unique identify for it. The logo was meant to different than the original logo of the company we chose. We also added a slogan that would emphasize and go with the brand. </figcaption>

            <img src="img/thumb-printproduct.png" alt="Thumbnail">
          </a>
          <figcaption>The purpose of this assignment was to create a template that I would be able to utilize, download, and open in InDesign to work with. I had to create measurements based off the template. I also worked with organizing and naming the layers to be more efficient. I also was capable of hiding the template layer in the end. </figcaption>

              <img src="img/thumb-posterskills.png" alt="">
            </a>
            <figcaption>I used 4 different images and used the skills I learned to blend them all together. I used a background of landscape and took elements from other images to create a new composition. </figcaption>

              </a>
              <figcaption>I shot a picture of a plant and was capable to blur the background. I also was capable of bringing the focus to the main flower and the leaves. After taking the image, I was able to adjust the color and tone of the image in Lightroom. </figcaption>

                </a>
                <figcaption>I created an "About" webpage that displays a grid of nine cards. Each card had listed   parks to visit in Washington. Each card is containing the location, size of park, and who manages the park. Each card has a hover effect with a bright sea blue to match the background. </figcaption>
