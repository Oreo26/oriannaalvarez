      Hi my name is Orianna Alvarez and I am currently 23 years old. I am
      majoring in Business Management and minoring in Design. I am a scorpio and
      my favorite color is red. I like to design for fun and spend a lot of time
      trying new things with a Cricut. I've learned how design tumblers, shadow
      boxes, and most recently Christmas ornaments.
